To check that RESTHeart is up and running, open the URL [http://localhost:8080/ping](http://localhost:8080/ping). You will see the message:

> Greetings from RESTHeart!

Alternatively, you can open the above URL using a command line HTTP client like [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) and [httpie](https://httpie.org) or an API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com).

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/ping
```
