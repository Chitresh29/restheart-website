## IntroductionÂ 

RESTHeart works *out-of-the-box* by merely installing it and requires no coding. On the other side real applications often need the API to be extended in some way.

With RESTHeart you can easily access MongoDB via a REST API, but it's also possible to create any kind of custom Web service.

Please have a look at [these examples](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-examples/) for understanding how to extend RESTHeart with Java.
