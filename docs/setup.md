## Ready to go?

If you are ready to install RESTHeart, follow this [Quickstart]({% link docs/quickstart.md %}) guide.

## Get set up for tutorials

If you are ready to follow beginner or advanced RESTHeart tutorials your system must meet the following prerequisites:

- HTTP port `8080` is available for local installations
- Localhost on port `27017` is available for JAVA installations
- the RESTHeart platform is run on the localhost with the default configuration

> For the default configuration the database restheart has been initiated and is bound to / and the user admin exists with the default password secret.


## Customisation

RESTHeart is highly-customisable through the use of configuration files, environment variables, and plugins.


### RESTHeart setup options

RESTHeart may be run with Java, Docker, or you can build it yourself using [Maven](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and Java.
