## Introduction

RESTHeart is a very good fit for **headless CMS** use cases, as it allows to effectively manage and aggregate content and its metadata, such as images, audios and videos, delivering them via a REST API.

{: .alert.alert-info }
RESTHeart offers complete binary files management. It's possible to **create**, **read** and **delete** even huge files. RESTHeart makes use of MongoDB's **GridFS**, a specification for storing and retrieving files that exceed the BSON-document size limit of 16 MB.

You can read more about GridFS [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/gridfs/).

## Example with http

Let's use [httpie](https://httpie.org) to upload a PNG image named "[dataflow.png](/images/dataflow.png)"

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-warning }
__Note__: RESTHeart's HTTP clients must adhere to the **multipart/form-data** specification. However the specification allows a form to upload multiple files at the same time, but RESTHeart prohibits that: while it's possible to POST / PUT several different non-binary parts for each file, it's mandatory to upload one single binary file per each POST / PUT request. This limitation is necessary to univocally relate all the optional parts to the unique file.

### POST a binary file

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-success }
In this example we assume RESTHeart is running on `localhost`, port `8080`.

Create the default `restheart` database, if none exists yet:

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
PUT / HTTP/1.1
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 1o6j8dt1f5y6jlu05t0blw2q4g280cgdv8253ilqhyoskoi5de
Auth-Token-Location: /tokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2019-07-04T09:24:37.171231Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json

ETag: 5d1dc2510951267987cf8ab1
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

Create the collection for hosting files. It must end with `.files` to
mark this as a special collection for files:

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
PUT /mybucket.files HTTP/1.1
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 1o6j8dt1f5y6jlu05t0blw2q4g280cgdv8253ilqhyoskoi5de
Auth-Token-Location: /tokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2019-07-04T09:26:41.654633Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 04 Jul 2019 09:11:41 GMT
ETag: 5d1dc2cd0951267987cf8ab2
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

Then POST the file:

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
POST /mybucket.files HTTP/1.1

@dataflow.png
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 5r9jcdp1yzfa1uwx0nety86bgwz5fq5wmd17qjjajcbxw5ptzy

Date: Fri, 05 Jul 2019 06:53:10 GMT
Location: http://localhost:8080/mybucket.files/5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab4
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

The `Location` HTTP header returns the file's location:

{: .black-code }
``` http
Location: http://localhost:8080/mybucket.files/5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab4
```

{: .alert.alert-info }
Note that the location contains the object ID automatically generated by
MongoDB (see the string `5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab4` at the end of the
above Location URL). This is a unique identifier and it's convenient in many
situation, but it's not always desirable. In many case it would be
better to explicitly name the resource with something more readable and
meaningful. To set the resource name it is necessary to upload the file
by using the PUT verb instead of POST. We'll show this later.

If you GET the `Location`, RESTHeart actually returns the file's metadata:

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
GET http://localhost:8080/mybucket.files/5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab4 HTTP/1.1
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http

{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab4"
    }, 
    "_links": {
        "rh:data": {
            "href": "/mybucket.files/5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab4/binary"
        }
    }, 
    "chunkSize": 261120, 
    "filename": "file", 
    "length": {
        "$numberLong": "232201"
    }, 
    "md5": "543dacb294d6fad4eb019b33b7192a4d", 
    "metadata": {
        "_etag": {
            "$oid": "5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab3"
        }, 
        "contentType": "image/png"
    }, 
    "uploadDate": {
        "$date": 1562309590133
    }
}
```

The actual binary content is available by appending the `binary` postfix, like this:

{: .black-code }
```
http://localhost:8080/mybucket.files/5d1ef3d50951267987cf8ab4/binary
```

Note that the browser might show a popup window asking for credentials. As usual, use `admin:secret`.

{: .bs-callout.bs-callout-warning }
Once a file has been created it becomes **immutable**: only its metadata can be updated. Practically, to update an existing file it's necessary to delete and re-create it.

### Uploading files with PUT

In the previous examples, the `mybucket.files` owner by default assigned to new files a resource name coming from MongoDB. If we want to set a meaningful URL then we need to send a PUT, like this:

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}


{: .black-code }
``` http
PUT /mybucket.files/dataflow.png HTTP/1.1

@dataflow.png
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 5r9jcdp1yzfa1uwx0nety86bgwz5fq5wmd17qjjajcbxw5ptzy
Auth-Token-Location: /tokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2019-07-05T07:24:04.146509Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 05 Jul 2019 07:09:04 GMT
X-Powered-By: restheart.org

```

If we GET the resulting resource, here is the full HTTP response:

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
GET /mybucket.files/dataflow.png HTTP/1.1
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 5r9jcdp1yzfa1uwx0nety86bgwz5fq5wmd17qjjajcbxw5ptzy
Auth-Token-Location: /tokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2019-07-05T07:39:57.206643Z

X-Powered-By: restheart.org

{
    "_id": "dataflow.png", 
    "_links": {
        "rh:data": {
            "href": "/mybucket.files/dataflow.png/binary"
        }
    }, 
    "chunkSize": 261120, 
    "filename": "file", 
    "length": {
        "$numberLong": "232201"
    }, 
    "md5": "543dacb294d6fad4eb019b33b7192a4d", 
    "metadata": {
        "_etag": {
            "$oid": "5d1ef4f50951267987cf8ab6"
        }, 
        "contentType": "image/png"
    }, 
    "uploadDate": {
        "$date": 1562309877118
    }
}

```

Note that in this case the resource has a much nicer URL:

```plain
http://localhost:8080/mybucket.files/dataflow.png
```

Which is easier to read and link than the automatically generated name.


### The "properties" part

To add optional form data parts to the request it is necessary to embed the data into the `properties` field name. The content of this field is automatically parsed as JSON data, so it must be valid JSON.

In the following example, we set the "author" and the "filename":

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
PUT /mybucket.files/dataflow.png HTTP/1.1

@dataflow.png properties='{"author":"SoftInstigate", "filename":"dataflow"}'
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ETag, X-Powered-By
Auth-Token: 3e6cbhpj5auv459nvu51y292xo13sco265hmw6ul7ecgsm5tix
Auth-Token-Location: /tokens/admin
Auth-Token-Valid-Until: 2019-07-09T11:41:55.806010Z
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 09 Jul 2019 11:26:55 GMT
X-Powered-By: restheart.org
```

The JSON will be merged into in the metadata section:

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Request" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http
GET /mybucket.files/dataflow.png HTTP/1.1
```

{% include code-header.html 
    type="Response" 
%}

{: .black-code }
``` http

        }, 
        "author": "SoftInstigate", 
        "contentType": "image/png", 
        "filename": "dataflow"
    }, 
    "uploadDate": {
        "$date": 1562671692338
    }
}
```

### GET a binary file

As shown above, when we GET the representation for the newly created file the response contains only its metadata.

Appending \``/binary`\` at the end of the above URL makes returns the actual binary content stored into GridFS. Open 

[http://localhost:8080/mybucket.files/dataflow.png/binary](http://localhost:8080/mybucket.files/dataflow.png/binary)

If we paste this URL to a browser's address bar then the image is displayed. This allows RESTHeart to serve as a very basic but powerful digital asset management system.

![](/images/dataflow.png){:
width="640" height="auto" class="image-center img-responsive"}
