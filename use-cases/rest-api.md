# Significant Development Cost Savings Using RESTHeart

{: .text-justify .mt-5 .mb-5}
RESTHeart is a standalone server-side application that connects to a MongoDB database (and MongoDB compatible databases) and immediately exposes all MongoDB’s capabilities through a complete REST API, enabling read and write of JSON documents and binary data via HTTP.

Developers don’t need to write a single line of backend code to serve data and content to Mobile Apps and Angular, React, Vue, or other Single Page Application frameworks.

RESTHeart provides a strong security module for authentication, authorization, and data caching. It enables effective management of content and its metadata – such as images, tags, categories, geo-localized data, audio, and video. All accessible through a clean REST API.

In most scenarios, RESTHeart is the perfect server-side backend for mobile and web applications, so that frontend developers can focus on building User Interfaces.
