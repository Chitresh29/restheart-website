# Subscription

RESTHeart is an open-core product distributed through a dual licensing model:

1. **Open Source** - under the [GNU AGPL v3.0 license](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/COMM-LICENSE.txt).
2. **Enterprise** - under a [business-friendly license](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/COMM-LICENSE.txt).

When a company is not comfortable with the AGPL open source license or need **dedicated technical support**, then it could purchase a **RESTHeart Subscription**, which comes with:

-   Perpetual, business-friendly **Enterprise license** with optional custom terms.
-   12 months of **technical support**.
-   12 months of supported upgrades to any new release of the product.
-   Training (optional).
-   Professional Services (optional).

The Enterprise license is **perpetual** and overcomes some limitations of the AGPL v3. Specifically, it grants the following rights:

-   Use RESTHeart in **closed source** applications.
-   Distribute RESTHeart **embedded** in closed source products.
-   Get coverage against some **legal risks**, like third-parties IP claims.

_While the Enterprise license is perpetual, the subscription is annual and has to be explicitly renewed._

# How many subscriptions do I need to buy?

It’s simple: buy **one RESTHeart subscription for each MongoDB production instance** you want to connect to.
So, with one annual subscription you get a single license that allows your company to:

-   Run unlimited RESTHeart instances, connected to any number of **non-production** database instances (dev, test, staging, ...).
-   Run a single RESTHeart instance, connected to one database **production** instance at a time.

_Custom Subscriptions containing multiple licenses for multiple database production instances are available upon request._

# Open source

If you are a student, individual developer or a small Web agency and comfortable with the AGPL v3 license, then using the product for free, as open source, is likely to be your best option.

The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ([AGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)) is a copyleft license nearly identical to the GPLv3.
As the AGPL is based on the GPL, not the LGPL, it does not contain any linking exceptions, and any derivative work using AGPL code (linked or otherwise, modified or not) must also be AGPL licensed and distributed.

-   A Software that interacts with RESTHeart via its REST API is not considered as a Derivative Work.
-   The RESTHeart Java Extension Framework (restheart-commons) is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License: custom plugins don’t incur in the limitations of the AGPL.
-   Any modification of RESTHeart’s source code must be released as open source, under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.
